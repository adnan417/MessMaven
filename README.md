# MessMaven
This is a Hostel Mess Management project. Its backend is written in nodejs and frontend is in HTML,CSS, Bootstrap and JavScript. This project is not complete. Some of the important features like authentication are missing. Once authentication is done, the project can be used. It has some cool features like Payment integration. It can be used as a base to make a full fledged hostel mess management system. This project is still in progress.
